Approach
1 Understanding the Problem:
We are given an array of integers called citations. Each element citations[i] represents the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper. We need to determine the researcher's h-index based on these citations.

2 What is the h-index?:
The h-index is a metric used to measure both the productivity and citation impact of a researcher's publications. It is defined as the maximum value of h such that the researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

3 Example:
Let's understand the first example:

4 Input: [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The researcher has 5 papers. The citations for each paper are [3,0,6,1,5]. To calculate the h-index, we need to find the maximum value of h such that the researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times. In this case, the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each ([3,6,5]), and the remaining two have no more than 3 citations each ([0,1]). So, the h-index is 3.
Approach to solve:
To find the h-index, we can follow these steps:

Sort the citations array in non-decreasing order.
Iterate through the sorted array and check for each element citations[i], if it is greater than or equal to n - i, where n is the total number of papers (length of citations array).
The first i for which citations[i] >= n - i is the h-index.
5 Example 2:

Input: [1,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The researcher has 3 papers. The citations for each paper are [1,3,1]. After sorting, the array becomes [1,1,3]. Here, the first paper has 3 citations which is greater than or equal to 3 - 0, so the h-index is 1.
6 Implementation:
We can implement this approach in code using any programming language. Here's a Java implementation:

import java.util.Arrays;

public class HIndexCalculator {
    public static int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int n = citations.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= n - i) {
                return n - i;
            }
        }
        return 0; // If no h-index found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] citations1 = {3, 0, 6, 1, 5};
        System.out.println(hIndex(citations1)); // Output: 3

        int[] citations2 = {1, 3, 1};
        System.out.println(hIndex(citations2)); // Output: 1
    }
}

Q1. Why do we need to sort citations?
  Here's why sorting is necessary:

To Apply the Definition of h-index:
The h-index definition requires that for a researcher to have an h-index of h, they must have published at least h papers with at least h citations each. Sorting the array in non-decreasing order allows us to easily identify how many papers have at least h citations.

Facilitates the Iterative Check:
By sorting the array, we can iterate through it and perform a simple check for each citation count. We start from the smallest citation count and move towards larger counts. This allows us to efficiently determine the h-index without needing nested loops or complex data structures.

Enables Linear Time Complexity:
Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the number of papers. However, once sorted, finding the h-index only requires a single linear scan through the array, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n), which is efficient for typical sizes of the citation array.

In summary, sorting the citations array simplifies the process of identifying the h-index and allows for a more straightforward implementation with better time complexity.

Q2. how did you write this if statement 
  if (citations[i] >= n - i) {
                return n - i;
            }
what's the logic behind this statement   

The logic behind the if statement is based on the definition of the h-index. Let's break it down:

citations[i] >= n - i:
In the sorted array, citations[i] represents the number of citations for the ith paper, and n - i represents the number of papers that have at least citations[i] citations.

Return n - i:
If citations[i] is greater than or equal to the number of papers with at least citations[i] citations (n - i), it means that there are at least n - i papers with citations[i] citations. According to the definition of the h-index, this condition satisfies the requirement for the h-index. Therefore, we return n - i as the h-index.

The logic ensures that we find the maximum value of h such that the researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times, as defined by the h-index.
